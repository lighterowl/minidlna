# This is an unofficial, abandoned fork

**This project is now abandoned : I have since moved to using MPD which suits my usecase much better. The repository will remain readonly for those who find my modifications worthwhile.**

This is my own fork which is not supported in any way by the original
authors. It contains modifications that I use in my own installation of
minidlna, which _may_ be exclusive to my own setup and thus might not
work in your case, or you might find them annoying.

No compatibility guarantees (in terms of working with other hardware, or
the program's database format) are made. Be prepared to rebuild your DB
from scratch or your devices not suddenly working with this particular
version.

You are of course by all means welcome to use these sources : if you do,
I'll appreciate the feedback. Thanks in advance!
